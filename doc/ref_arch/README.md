## Principles
**Preamble**
    CNTT develops a limited number of NFVI reference architectures. While technology and deployment aspects may differ between them, each of the CNTT reference architectures is based on a common CNTT Reference Model. 

There is a number of key architectural principles that apply to all reference architecture produced by CNTT. These principles are enumerated below.  They are meant to be general and at high level, and very limited in number. Some of the chapters of this document will inlcude more specific principles to provide the implementation guidelines for a particular function or a specific component. 

We need to distinguish between architectural principles and architectural requirements elaborated later in this document. The principles are here to guide our architectural thinking, while requirements should be understood as a check list used to gauge a level of compliance of a NFVI implementation to the CNTT reference architecture.

1. **Open source preference:** To ensure that suppliers’ and operators’ investment have a tangible pathway towards a standard and production ready NFVI solution portfolio. 

1. **Interoperability of interfaces:** To ensure interoperability and minimize integration efforts.

1. **Disaggregation between clearly defined layers:** To ensure proper separation of concern and allow for component substitutionas.

1. **Automated lifecycle management:** To minimize costs of the whole lifecycle and avoid errors and discrepancies resulting from manual processes.

1. **Automated scalability and elasticity:** To enable scaling out of workloads to minimize costs and operational impacts.

1. **Automated closed loop assurance:** To minimize operational costs and simplify operations.

1. **Cloud nativeness strategic direction:** To utilise resource and operational efficiencies of cloud native implementations

1. **Security compliance:** To ensure compliance at all level to industry and regional security requirements
