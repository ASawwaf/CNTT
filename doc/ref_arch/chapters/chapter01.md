## 1.3 Principles

1. CNTT operator/supplier community must proactively influence open source activities.
1. Interaction between components of NFVI and with external systems like MANO must be implemented according to Open Published API specifications. 
1. NFVI must be architected to allow High Availability and Resilience for hosted VNFs. 
1. Use flexible hardware and networking architecture to find balance between horizontal and vertical scaling. 
1. Deployment and life-cycle management of  NFVI instances must be done via an automated process.
1. NFVI Platform Architecture must support automated assurance and minimize complexity of operations and maintenance. 
1. NFVI platform access controls must use 2FA authentication using encrypted connection and at all levels must comply with industry and regional security regulations.
